#SWEN 301 Assignment 2

##a)
Any special Instructions to run the tests (if needed)

##b)
A reflection on the test coverage reports (in particular, an explanation why certain parts of the code are not covered). Insert a summary of the reports (e.g., embed a screenshot)

##c)
An evaluation which of the layouts, T1Layout or T2Layout, you recommend for use. Base your decision on your experience (ease of use), technical aspects (e.g. performance as shown in the stress tests, stability, number and size of direct and indirect dependencies), and social aspects (size and activity of developer community, license, support like mailing lists and stackoverflow topics, usage by others, … ) 

##d)
The README should be brief, at least 300 but not more than 800 words


##Penalties
 - violations of naming rules 
 - violating the Maven standard project layout 
 - use of absolute references (e.g., libraries should not be referenced using absolute paths like “C:\\Users\\..”, instead use relative references w.r.t. the project root folder)
 - references to local libraries (libraries should be referenced via the Maven repository)
 - use of libraries not on the whitelist (unless they are only used via transitive dependencies)
 - not using git for development (only using a very few large commits)
